The purpose of my app is for the chef to set/display a menu he has prepared for that day and helps customers to know what is available on the menu. the purpose of this app is to provide users with an easy accessible way to see which meals are prepared. a lot of people lately are always on their phones so this app l created it to eliminate the need to ask for menus then end up finding out that dish is not available on the day, they could simply do it on their phones.

HOW MY APP WORKS The user will launch the app after he or she launches the app they will come across a home page which has a logo and next button, for them to access the main screen they have to click the button that’s written next.The user will see this screen only if they previously clicked on the button that’s written "next". If the user clicks on Navigation page
it will serve as a central hub, which will allows the chef to easily find and access the features they need making it an essential component of an applications user interface. Menu Page, The menu page will display a menu depending on the option of course the chef selected in the previous page.
